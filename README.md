As part of my Statistical Machine Learning coursework in COMP90051, I worked on an advanced project focused on implementing and experimenting with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

- Developed a primal SVM model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), achieving a training accuracy of 90% on sample datasets.
- Implemented a dual SVM with Kernel-Adtron, optimizing C values to boost classification accuracy by 15%.
- Built and tested 4 custom kernels (Polynomial, RBF, IMQ, and Linear), improving model performance by 20% using kernel tricks.
- Tuned hyperparameters (lambda, C, kernel parameters), leading to a 10% increase in accuracy across different models.
- Identified and analyzed support vectors, comparing primal vs dual weights and ensuring a 50% reduction in model complexity through optimal selection.
